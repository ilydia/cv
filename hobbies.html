        <h4>Reading</h4>

      <p>Here are three facts about me: <br />
        My mom worked as a librarian in an elementary school. <br />
        I have a degree in Literature. <br />
        My first username was Bookworm110.</p>
        <p>Obviously, reading is an important part of my life.
          I typically read three books at a time: one physical book I read at home, one eBook for my commutes on the train, and one audiobook for the rest of the time.
        My favorite genres are literary fiction, literary nonfiction, scientific nonfiction, a good psychological thriller, and anything that makes me gasp in surprise or delight.
      My favorite book is <em>Rebecca</em> by Daphne du Maurier.</p>

        <h4>Binging Podcasts</h4>
      </li>
      <p>
        I'm a huge fan of podcasts, especially if they make me laugh or feel particularly tender-hearted.
        I listen to the NPR podcasts "It's Been a Minute with Sam Sanders," "Life Kit," and "Code Switch."
        From WNYC, I'm a fan of "Death, Sex, and Money," "The Anthropocene Reviewed," and "Dear Hank and John."
        The Maxfun Network releases several of my favorites, including "Sawbones," and "My Brother, My Brother, and Me."

        <h4>Hanging out with Marcy</h4>
      </li>
      <p>My dog is one of the best people I know. She's a real goofball who makes me laugh all the time.</p>
      <li>
        <h4>Having fun with Daniel</h4>
      </li>
      <p>Daniel makes me happy, whether we're on a new adventure or sitting together on the couch. He's my favorite boy.</p>
